##Instructions

Simply clone the project / download a zip and run index.html

##Summary

As a magician, I'd like to shuffle, draw and sort cards so that I can perform magic tricks

##Acceptance Criteria

1. Can I shuffle the deck of cards? 
2. Can I draw any given number of cards from the deck, with the cards being removed from the original deck? 
3. Can I draw any given number of cards from the deck and then sort the drawn cards, with the cards being removed from the original deck? 
4. Sorted cards are sorted by suit: Clubs, Spades, Hearts, Diamonds; then by value: Ace is high. 

##Back of card (Technical Constraints):

1. A simple User Interface is fine – though we’d love to see what you’re capable of! Use an appropriate language/framework for the job role that you are applying for. 
2. If you are applying for a Interactive Development role then we expect that you write a web application. However, 
if you are purely a serverside developer, we will accept the application running from the terminal, as well as from tests. 
3. With the exception of testing, minimise the use of external frameworks. 
4. Use best in industry engineering practices. 
5. Ensure that your code is well tested.

Note: User can flip the card by clicking on each card.
